\description{
These data were published in Kuiper and colleagues (2013), who set out to
aggregate evidence for the effect of prior interactions between partners on
trust in (economic) exchange relations across four heterogeneous replication
studies. Batenburg et al. (2003) analyzed survey data using linear regression
with covariates; Buskens and Raub (2002) analyzed experimental data using
linear regression; Buskens and Weesie (2000) used an experimental design with
a binary outcome, analyzed using probit regression; and Buskens, Raub, and
Van der Veer (2010) used a longitudinal experimental design, analyzing the
data with a three-level logistic regression. These studies each provide a
regression coefficient (beta) assessing the effect of past experience on
trust, and its estimated sampling variance (squared standard error). The
sample sizes (n) were derived from the original publications.
